# Prosthetic Hand – Portfolio Edition

This repository contains the **structured and refined portfolio version** of a prosthetic robotic hand project that I originally worked on as a collaborator in a shared repository.

The goal of this version is to present the project in a clean, professional, and easy-to-navigate format with clearer documentation, structured phases, renamed files, and personal notes added during research and development.

## 👤 About This Version

- The original collaborative repository can be found here:  
  🔗 https://github.com/Runarok/Prosthetic-Arm  
- This version has been reorganized, renamed, and improved to serve as my **personal documented version** for learning, demonstration, and portfolio usage.
- All restructuring, additional explanations, formatting improvements, and reorganized documentation have been done by **@Amanotsuki**.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Develop a servo-controlled robotic prosthetic hand using Arduino
- Explore mechanical and electrical design approaches
- Document the decision-making process, references, prototypes, and tests
- Create research-level documentation useful for future extension or publication

## 📁 Repository Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|------------|
| `phase-01` | Early research, literature study, initial reports, and academic submissions |
| `phase-02` | Design exploration, mechanical concepts, prototype direction, revised scope |
| `resources/` | External references, research material, diagrams, and related documentation |
| `CODE/` | Arduino control code, logic files, and any application-related components |
| `Application/` | APK or mobile control application (if available) |

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Arduino Uno / Nano (Microcontroller)
- Servo Motors (Finger actuation)
- C / Arduino IDE
- 3D-printed mechanical structure (depending on prototype)
- Android App (optional control interface)

---

## 🧪 Outcomes

This project demonstrates:

- How servo-actuated prosthetic hands can be engineered using low-cost components
- Research-based design thinking approach (literature → concept → validation)
- Real-world documentation and iterative development instead of polished-only results

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Planned or possible directions:

- EMG-based (muscle signal) control
- Improved servo mapping & smoother motion logic
- Better mechanical tolerance / redesigned linkage system
- Wireless BLE app integration
- Force or flex-sensor feedback
